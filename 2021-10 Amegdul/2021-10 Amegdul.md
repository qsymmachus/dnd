In the immediate moments after Marley pulled the warp lever, nothing seems to happen. For a second you stand silently in the control room, looking at each other, and wondering if this already malfunctioning planar sphere was going to remain stuck inside Castle Yorba forever.

But then a low hum begins to sound, and the floors shudder, and with a jolt the walls of the sphere start to move, rotating counter-clockwise. The hum grows louder, and the walls speed up to a dizzying spin, and suddenly time stops, your mind stuck on your last thought, and your stomach feels like it is being pulled straight down into the ground. 

Just as a sense of panic starts to flicker inside of you, the room shakes with a loud clap, the humming dies down, and the spinning walls slow to a halt.

Mork leans over the control panel, and notes that the destination sigil and the location sigil now match. You've arrived at your destination, though you have no idea where that may be. You can only trust that someone from the Mage's Guild will be here to meet you, and free you from the geas that still weighs on your mind.

You make your way out from the center of the sphere, and find yourselves at the exit. The iris door is closed, and in place of a button next to the door like the others in the sphere, there is a small brass wand stuck in slot in the wall. "Looks like a key to me," Mork says, and he plucks it out of the wall, hiding it within his robes. With the key removed, the door opens, and you step into blinding sunlight.

Dock
----

The sun is so bright at first that you can only look down as you walk down a metal gangway from the sphere. As your vision adjusts, you realize that the sphere is floating hundreds of feet in the air, far above a landscape of red and orange rock. 

Somehow the gangway leads down to a stone platform, and you realize that you are standing on top of great rock pillar, surrounded by a vast desert landscape. As you look to the north, you see more rock pillars, each hundreds of feet tall, all growing out of a dry valley floor that is bounded by stone mesas to the east and west. 

Stranger still, a small city seems to have been built on top of this pillar, hewn into the very rock. You're standing in a wide round turret, cluttered with rows of barrels and crates. If you weren't in the desert and hundreds of feet and in the air, you'd think you were at a loading dock.

But there is a ship here, tied to a mooring on the wall, floating not on water but on the air. Instead of sails, the ship is masted to a great patchwork ballon, bobbing in the desert wind.

"Oi what's this then!" a gruff voice suddenly rings out as a portly, sweaty man shuffles toward you. "This docking wasn't scheduled. That airship is much to big for this slip," he says, pointing at the sphere. It's the __dockmaster__. "Who's going to pay for this slip? It's gonna cost yous extra for all the trouble you're causing."

The players may try to explain themselves to the dockmaster. Within a minute though, you hear footsteps coming up stone stairs. A young man with blond hair and a rust red cloak appears – you recognize him as __Marek__, the guild operative you met in Carnivale, and the man who convinced you to warp to this strange place. "Mario!" he shouts, "What are you doing harassing my contractors? They're here on business." 

Mario and Marek step aside to talk, and after a few muttered protests and an exchange of a coin purse, Mario throws up his hands and turns to bark orders at a dockhand.

"My friends!" Marek smiles as we strides toward you, he's clearly relieved to see you here. "Welcome to Amegdul, the finest trading city along the Cindar Road." Marek will answer the player's questions for a few minutes, but then insist they hurry to meet Wilfrid. He's the main reason you're here – Wilfrid is one of the only wizards who knows how to dispell Mercurio's geas.

Wilfrid
-------

This small dusty door off the alley has a piece of parchment nailed to it, in a shakey hand someone has written: "Wilfrid – Sage, Appraiser, and Notary Public." Marek knocks on the door in a particular rapping pattern, and a voice shouts from inside, with a hint of annoyance, "Come in, come in..."

A very cramp study has been carved into the rock, stuffed so full of bookshelves that you all bump shoulders trying to fit in the room. A bright blue runic pattern has been carved in the floor.

A very old halfling, in robes that were once a bright blue but are now sun-faded and dusty, is working at a desk against the back wall. Marek flashes the silver owl at him, and explains the situation.

Wilfrid will ask the players to stand on the rune at the center of the room. With a muttering chant, and the waving of a heavy metal wand nearly as long as he is tall, Wilfrid will dispell Mercurio's geas. You feel a weight lift off your mind, and a new energy and enthusiasm you haven't felt in days. You're excited to find out what happens next.

If the players stick around, Wilfrid will appraise any magical items they might have, and offer to buy them if he's interested. He has peculiar interests.
