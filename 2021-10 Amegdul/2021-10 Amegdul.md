![Labeled map](./map-labeled.png)

In the immediate moments after Marley pulled the warp lever, nothing seems to happen. For a second you stand silently in the control room, looking at each other, and wondering if this already malfunctioning planar sphere was going to remain stuck inside Castle Yorba forever.

But then a low hum begins to sound, and the floors shudder, and with a jolt the walls of the sphere start to move, rotating counter-clockwise. The hum grows louder, and the walls speed up to a dizzying spin, and suddenly time stops, your mind stuck on your last thought, and your stomach feels like it is being pulled straight down into the ground. 

Just as a sense of panic starts to flicker inside of you, the humming dies down, and the spinning walls slow to a halt.

Mork leans over the control panel, and notes that the destination sigil and the location sigil now match. You've arrived at your destination, though you have no idea where that may be. You can only trust that someone from the Mage's Guild will be here to meet you, and free you from the geas that binds you to Mercurio's will.

You make your way out from the center of the sphere, and find yourselves at the exit. The iris door is closed, and in place of a button next to the door like the others in the sphere, there is a small brass wand stuck in slot in the wall. "Looks like a key to me," Mork says, and he plucks it out of the wall, hiding it within one of his many billowing and voluminous pockets. With the key removed, the door opens, and you step into blinding sunlight.

Dock
----

The sun is so bright at first that you can only look down as you walk down a metal gangway from the sphere. As your vision adjusts, you realize that the sphere is floating hundreds of feet in the air, far above a landscape of red and orange rock. 

Somehow the gangway leads down to a stone platform, and you realize that you are standing on top of great rock spire, surrounded by a vast desert landscape. As you look to the north, you see more spires, each hundreds of feet tall, all growing out of a dry valley floor that is bounded by stone mesas to the east and west. 

Stranger still, a small city seems to have been built on top of this spire, hewn into the very rock. You're standing in a wide round turret, cluttered with rows of barrels and crates. If you weren't in the desert and hundreds of feet and in the air, you'd think you were at a shipping dock.

But there is a ship here, tied to a mooring on the wall, floating not on water but on the very air. Instead of sails, the ship is masted to a great patchwork ballon, bobbing in the desert wind.

"Oi what's this then!" a gruff voice suddenly rings out as a portly, sweaty man shuffles toward you. "This docking wasn't scheduled. That airship is much to big for this slip," he says, pointing at the sphere. It's the __dockmaster__. "Who's going to pay for this slip? It's gonna cost yous extra for all the trouble you're causing."

The players may try to explain themselves to the dockmaster. Within a minute though, you hear footsteps coming up stone stairs. A young man with blond hair and a rusty red cloak appears – you recognize him as __Marek__, the guild operative you met in Carnivale, and convinced you to warp to this strange place. "Mario!" he shouts, "What are you doing harassing my contractors? They're here on business." 

Mario and Marek step aside to talk, and after a few muttered protests and an exchange of a coin purse, Mario throws up his hands and turns to bark orders at a dockhand.

"My friends!" Marek smiles and strides toward you. He's clearly relieved to see you here. "Welcome to Amegdul, the finest trading city along the Cloud Road." Marek will answer the player's questions for a few minutes, but then insist they hurry to meet Wilfrid. He's the main reason you're here – Wilfrid is one of the only wizards who knows how to dispell Mercurio's geas.

A __cannon__ sits at the center of the dock, resting on a round track that allows it to swivel 360 degrees. It is cast iron, inscribed with angular runes, and the cannon's mouth is stylized to look like a dragon's. The crafstmanship is so fine that you can count the individual scales around the dragon's head. Tilden will recognize this as dwarvern work, and it is hundreds of years old at least.

### Dragon Cannon (twelve pounder)

* __Armor Class__ 18
* __Hit Points__ 45
* __Ranged Weapon Attack__ +6 to hit, range 500/2000 feet, 5d10 bludgeoning damage.

Wilfrid
-------

This small dusty door off the alley has a piece of parchment nailed to it. In a shakey hand someone has written: "Wilfrid – Sage, Appraiser, and Notary Public." Marek knocks on the door in a particular rapping pattern, and a voice shouts from inside, with a hint of annoyance, "Come in, come in..."

A very cramp study has been carved into the rock, stuffed so full of bookshelves that you all bump shoulders trying to fit in the room. A bright blue runic pattern has been carved in the floor.

A very old halfling, in robes that were once a bright blue but are now sun-faded and dusty, is working at a small desk against the back wall. Marek flashes the silver owl at him, and explains the situation.

Wilfrid will ask the players to stand on the rune at the center of the room. With a muttering chant, and the waving of a heavy metal wand nearly as long as he is tall, Wilfrid will dispell Mercurio's geas. You feel a weight lift off your mind, and a new energy and enthusiasm you haven't felt in days. You're excited to find out what happens next.

If the players stick around, Wilfrid will appraise any magical items they might have, and offer to buy them if he's interested. He has peculiar interests. He's also a notary public, and can notarize documents.

Bazaar
------

Steps from the dock lead down to an open courtyard with small colonnades running down either side. A few people are milling about under the arcades and out of the hot sun. You see several small streets and passageways winding off to the south and east.

A elvish man sits on an dusty carpet with a coffee set, smoking a long pipe carved from pale soapstone. Uncharacteriscally for an elf, his skin is wrinkled and deeply tanned. He'll make small talk with the players, answering any questions they have about Amegdul. He'll be very curious about the sphere, and ask a lot of questions about it.

Spearsmith
----------

If it was hot outside, it's oppressively hot in here, with a furnace raging at the far end of the room. Well-placed windows and an open entrance create a powerful draft through the room, but it's not enough to keep you from dripping sweat.

A seven-foot tall, musclebound lizardfolk is hammering away at an anvil. She merely nods when you enter, and continues hammering.

She'll stop hammering if the players speak to her, and show them her wares. She sells most common arms and armor, but she grows animated when asked about her specialty, two-pronged spears. The spearheads are made from blackened steel and have two sharp points, set on a sturdy shaft of ashwood. Silk tassles are tied under the spearhead in a variety of colors.

* Two-pronged spear, +1 to hit, 1d6 damage +4, thrown 20/60 feet. 1200 gold.

Her finest spears have heads made of rippling damascene steel, and needle-sharp points.

* Masterwork two-pronged spear, +3 to hit, 1d6 damage +6, thrown 20/60 feet. 4000 gold.

Sulla's Sundries
----------------

Every inch of space in this round room is filled with crates, barrels, fine carpets, sculptures, curiousities, and other sundries. A short, squat man in expensive looking clothes stands at a table scribbling at a ledger. He spread your arms and welcomes you in exaggerated fashion – "Travellers! Welcome, one and all, to Sulla's sundries, the finest merchant and provisioner on the air!"

Much of what's for sale here is in bulk, and primarily geared for traders – crates of dates, fine carpets, copper ingots. There are a few curiosities that may be of interest to you:

* [Robe of Scintillating Colors](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/robe-of-scintillating-colors), 4000 gold.
* [Ioun Stone of Agility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ioun-stone), 6000 gold
* [Boots of Striding and Springing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/boots-of-striding-and-springing), 5000 gold

Street Vendor
-------------

A gnomish man with a forked white beard is kneeling on a carpet, chopping some herbs. Small cauldrons and urns bubble around him, much of it smells fragrant, but the aroma is mixed in with harsh and acrid smells. He has the following potions for sale:

* [Potion of Climbing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-climbing), 150 gold
* [Potion of Mind Reading](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-mind-reading), 250 gold
* [Potion of Greater Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing), 180 gold
* [Potion of Supreme Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing), 450 gold

South Pillar
------------

This rock spire is cut with narrow passageways and doors leading to small homes carved into the rock. The doors are locked, and players can barge in if they like, but won't find much of value. The eastern-most home is occupied and the owner will be very upset if the players break into their house.

The Spur
--------

A small flattened area has been dug into the top of this rock spire, but it is otherwise open to the elements. Two men have set up camp here – local traders you're told, who either can't afford a night at the Inn or couldn't find space anywhere else. They are reticent, and eye you suspiciously. They seem well-built for tradesmen.

Garden Pillar
-------------

The open space on the top of this spire has been transformed into a beautiful gem of a garden. Fragrant jasmine clings to the walls, and birds flit from branch to branch. At the center of the spire, crystal clear water gathers at the center of a stone font. When you peer down into the water, you do not see the bottom – it seems to extend endlessly into the depths of the spire.

The Dragon's Head
-----------------

The scent of cindar and coffee envelops you as you step into this cool and welcoming space. It is well insulated from the scorching sun with thick walls of sandstone.

Richly decorated carpets and cushions are spread on the ground. A trio of musicians play rhythmically at the center of the room, and to your left, a orange-and-black stripped Rakasha stands behind a bar, pouring coffee. An enormous green dragon's head hangs on the wall behind him – it looks real. An older man with a weathered face sits cross-legged in the corner of the room, nursing a hookah pipe with a slight smile on his lips. He nods in polite greeting.

If the players talk to the older man with the hookah, he will offer to share the pipe. His name is __Jerimo__, and he's an airship pilot for hire. He'll tell the players about the cloud road if they ask. He'll note that some traders he doesn't recognize docked here yesterday, and that they haven't been doing much trading.

You can purchase drinks and food from the bar. They can also pay for a bed for the night, which Marek recommends – you'll need to rest well what comes next.

Later that Night...
-------------------

The players settle into their beds at the back of the Dragon's Head for a night of hard-earned rest.

_All players should roll for initiative except Mork. Whoever rolls highest wakes up first._

You open your eyes, emerging from a dream at that edge of sleep and wakefulness where you're not quite sure what is real. As your eyes scan the room, it takes you a moment to remember where you are. You hear familiar breathing and Mork's snore nearby. A night wind gently rattles the window shutters. But for the moonbeams shining through gaps in the shutters, it's quite dark, and you can barely make out shapes in the room.

Suddenly, Your eyes freeze and pulse quickens. There is a figure in black standing over Mork's bed. Your mind flits through all the possibilities of could explain this, but it's clearly a person, and they're carefully reaching into Mork's pockets.

_The __Black Monk__ is searching Mork's pockets for the key to the Planar sphere. She will find it make a run for the sphere, unless the players stop her._

_Players in pursuit of the Black Monk will encounter _goons_ in dark robes, armed with crossbows or dual-wielding short swords, guarding key intersections in the streets. The players recognize a couple of these men as the "traders" they met on the south pillar the day before. These goons will try to stop or slow down the players, providing cover for the monk._

_The dock will additionally be guarded by an Aarakocra Warlock named __Kul__. He will sharply yell orders to the goons in Auran._

_Both the Black Monk and Kul will escape into the sphere and warp away if possible, leaving the goons behind. Once inside, they will lock the door and warp away within a few combat rounds._

_If both Kul and the Black Monk are killed or incapacitated, the remaining goons will attempt to escape on their __airship__._
