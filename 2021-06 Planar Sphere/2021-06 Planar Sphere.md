You have successfully infiltrated Castle Yorba and quickly ascend its endless flights of stairs, searching for the sphere. While you had been warned of the castle's heavy security, it seems most of those defenses were concentrated on the ground floor. You easily slip past the occasional servant you encounter in the stairwell. They're not on guard.

Normally in moments like these, with adventure afoot and everything going to plan, you would feel elated. But instead you feel anxious and worried, like a weight is pressing upon you. If things go bad, you know you won't be able to back out. You are powerless to resist Mercurio's command.

Suddenly you stop; something has caught Moroni's eye, and she signals you.

Barricades
----------

The stairwell has opened upon to cavernous hall, but nearly half of the space has been consumed by a massive, bronze-colored sphere. Judging by the sphere's curve, just a small section of its surface is exposed here; the rest of it is projecting outside of the castle walls. Despite its size, it is appears to float weightlessly in space, embedded in the castle like ball dropped in mud.

A small group of Yorban soldiers are clustered around the sphere, standing behind makeshift stone barricades. The room is so big that a crane has been placed here, presumably to build the stone walls. The soldiers are pointing wall guns at a small door on the face of the sphere. It's 12 feet off the ground, and a ladder has been propped in front of it.

Two men stand at a table to the east of the barricade, pointing at some diagrams and strategizing. One of these men is quite imposing, in full plate armor with gold trim, and a purple cape. His head is completely bald and his face is covered in scars.

If you speak with him, he'll ask who sent you here. He doesn't have time to spare. If asked, he'll identify himself as __Casimir Systema__, "servant of Lord Yorba". He won't be particularly suspicious of the players – after all, they wouldn't be in the castle if they weren't supposed to be – but he won't let them in the sphere without a good reason.

If asked – and if it seems like he has a good reason to tell these strangers – Casimir well tell you that he's already sent two squadrons into the sphere, and neither have returned. "The sphere's bloody dangerous, and it's shoved right up this castle's ass".

A dotty old wizard is standing to the west of the barricades, right at the sphere's edge. He's holding a small wand, and waving it over the sphere's surface. He's distracted, but will he'll tell you his name is __Seth__. "I'm analyzing this incredible machine".

If the players draw Seth out more, he'll explain he's been hired by the Yorbans to learn more about the sphere. It's a planar sphere, for sure, and based on his surface analysis it's been hopping from plane to plane for a long time. But it's so well-warded that he can't see anything inside.

Seth is a member of the Mage's Guild. If the players show him their silver owl and explain their situation, he'll convince Casimir to let them inside the sphere.

Sphere Entrance
---------------

The inside of the sphere is well light with a soft, warm light, though some sections of the hallway are dark, as if the magical source of this light has been extinguished. 

The walls seem to be made of lustrous bronze, with interesting ribbed supports and architectural flourishes. A walkway leads to hexagon-shaped room. There are circle-shaped doors to the north, southeast, and southwest. A long open hallway curves off to the northwest.

The floor is decorated with an intricate mosaic depicting spheres within spheres. More knowledgeable players will recognize it as a representation of the planar cosmology. 

Viewing Room
------------

The first thing you see upon entering the room is a small closet and cloaks hanging on hooks. The closet is full of various staffs, umbrellas, and shoes. They're all covered in a layer of dust.

A round table with a mirrory surface is at the center of the room. As you gaze at the surface, you see what at first looks like a map, but its incredibly detailed. Clouds drift above the landscape in three dimensions, and you can see the lapping of waves on the water. You recognize this as Carnivale, but seen from very high up, as a bird would see it.
