Amegdul
-------

_Use the `game-map.pdx` from the previous adventure in Amegdul._

Early morning in Amegdul. The sky is cool lavender, and the western mountains glow with the light of the rising sun. The smell of smoke billows on the breeze – the wreck of the attacking skyship is still smoldering on the desert floor below.

The townsfolk are waking up, and some of them stand gawking and at the bodies you have left in the street. Almost everyone heard last night's commotion, but they were afraid to leave their beds. You're gathered in the town square, patching up your wounds and trying to find your bearings. You got hardly any sleep, except Mork, who has snored loudly on the stone ground for the past hour. One thing dominates all your thoughts and conversations – the planar sphere is gone, stolen by unknown assailants. The only lead you have is a letter written in a rhyming tongue:

```
Brother Kul of feather fair

Alight at once upon the air

Make haste with arms to Amegdul

Of spire steep and water cool

The wefting orb awaits us soon

To reclaim and take to Hamagdoon

Destroy the heathens who hold the key

And bring it quickly back to me.
```

Kul, the bird wizard, lies dead on the ground. None of you have ever heard of "Hamagdoon". Who stole the sphere? Were these agents of Mercurio, the crime lord who had you capture the sphere in the first place? Or are different, darker powers at work? Stranger still, the guild agent who sent you here, Marek, is nowhere to be found.

Suddenly these thoughts are interrupted by a chattering, peeping sound and the whirring of gears. Marley starts fumbling through his pack, tracing the source of the noise. He pulls out the silver owl with ruby eyes, the token given to you by the Mage's Guild to identify you as their friends. What you had long assumed was just a silver trinket has suddenly come to life, flapping its wings and turning its head. Marley sets it on the ground, and it hops around in a circle as you all gather round it. Before you have a chance to digest what you're seeing, the little owl suddenly stops and speaks in a clear feminine voice:

> "Attention all friends and agents of the guild. We believe the nonce system has been compromised. Trust no one presenting an owl as a nonce. All agents in the prime material plane are instructed to return to Sakro Mendhi for briefing and to receive a new nonce. Agents outside the prime material plane should proceed to Sigil. Until then, all agent cells must operate alone. Proceed with extreme caution – the nature of the threat we are facing is not yet clear."

Having delivered its message, the little owl closes its wings and with a pop it explodes, scattering the ground with a halo of silver shards.

_At this stage, the players must decide what to do. The only way out of Amegdul is by skyship. They can hire Jerimo, whom they met at the Dragon's head inn, to pilot them to Sakro Mendhi for 400 gold. He is preparing his skyship at the dock._

Skyship Wreck
-------------

_This is located about midway along the travel map to the north, look for the scattered brown and purple remains of a ship._

The broken hull and deflated ballon of a skyship is lying scattered on the desert floor. Jerimo shakes his head when he sees it – "Looks like a merchant ship. Poor bastard must have been caught in a storm."

The players can land and search the wreck. There are no bodies, and the hull is partly buried in the sand; it must have crashed some time ago. The cargo has since been looted. 

You do however find a crossbow, but instead of loaded with bolts, it is loaded with a grappling hook and a rope. It looks like it could be used to shoot the grappling hook some distance.

### Grappling Hook Crossbow
* Fired by performing a ranged attack against a target.
* If the player hits their target, the grappling hook can secure the rope to a battlement, window ledge, tree limb, or other protrusion.
* If fired at a living target, the hook does 1d4 bludgeoning damage.
* Range 20/40 feet.

The Oasis
---------

_Located on the south central section of the travel map._

A desert oasis is nestled betwen the lee of a mountain and a tall stone pillar. Tall palm trees surround a lake of clear, cool water, welling from some unknown source deep in the ground.

A lone dwarf in dusty clothes is camping by the oasis, cooking meat on skewers over the fire. He has no skyship, but appears well equipped – "Travelling to Jo San, the slow way."

Jerimo raises his eyebrows at this. Crossing the desert by foot would be a death sentence for most.

If prompted, the dwarf will offer a little advice for the journey – avoid travelling the narrows at night.

Crossroads
----------

_Located just before the split between the narrows and the notch on the travel map. Look for the camping airships on the ground._

Jerimo explains that the crossroads are a common resting spot for travellers along the cloud road, located at the split between the narrows and the notch.

A couple other skyships have landed here for the night. One captain – a tall half orc with a scar down his right cheek – will warn the players that pirates have been sighted on the other side of the notch. "Be careful, they'll have an eye on a pretty galley like yours."

The other captain – a chatty gnome in patchwork robes – is eager to trade. He'll offer to buy items of interest from the players. He'll also offer a few items for sale:

* [Scroll of storm sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/storm-sphere) – 640 gold
* [Helm of Comprehending Languages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/helm-of-comprehending-languages) – 500 gold

From the crossroads, the skyship has two routes to choose from to continue west. 

To the south, the notch, a gate controlled by the city of Sakro Mendhi. "Faster, but the Sakro Mendhans will question ya, and make you pay a toll" Jerimo advises you.

To the north, the narrows, a winding, windy canyon. "Tricky road, usually slower, and some folk are superstitious about it" Jerimo adds, "I usually take it when I can't afford the toll."

The Notch
---------

A notch only 50 paces wide separate the two mountains bounding this valley, offering the only passage further west.

Two towers have been built high into the rockface on either side of the notch, hundreds of feet off the ground. The larger, northern tower has three large crenels cut into its walls, each providing a heavy cannon with a clear line of sight to your skyship and the valley below. The smaller, southern tower has only one narrow embrassure looking out on the valley. The banner of Sakro Mehndi – a golden lion on an ochre background – flies from the top of the southern towern.

A heavy chain is extended between the two towers. Each chainlink is the size of your head. "You can't go over or under that chain," Jerimo whispers, "wizard's work." The desert air shimmers around the chain, as if it were hot.

"Hold there, travellers!" a voice calls out from the southern tower. The embrassure is so narrow and the inside of the tower so dark that you can't see who's speaking. It sounds like an old man, his voice is barely loud enough to bridge the gap between your ship and the tower. "Beyond this valley lie domains of Sakro Mendhi, and all travellers must state their business before they continue west. What brings you here?"

Players will have the best luck if they pretend to be traders. If they prevaricate, or act suspicious, the gatekeeper won't let them pass. If they convince the gatekeeper that they're honest travellers, he'll ask them to pay a toll of 250 gold. Once paid, the magical chain will retract into the southern tower, floating on air.

Particularly foolish players may try to force their way through the notch. They'll be up against the tower's cannons, and a magical chain they can't cross, except with a __greater dispel__. They could also force their way into the tower and pull the lever at the chain base to retract it themselves. If players force their way through the notch, they will be wanted criminals in Sakro Mendhi.

### Tower Cannon

* __Armor Class__ 18
* __Hit Points__ 45 (damage threshold 10)
* __Ranged Weapon Attack__ +6 to hit, range 500/1000 feet, 5d10 bludgeoning damage.
