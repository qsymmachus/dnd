_Note that this map is meant to be split into two adventures. The first adventure is described in this document. It takes place in the streets of Sakro Mendhi and continues into the Mage's guild hideout, up to the point where the hideout is attacked._

With he pirate skiff captured, Jerimo nursed his wounds and guided your airship over the great desert surrounding Sakro Mendhi. Aided by a strong westerly wind, you arrive at Sakro Mendhi within half a day, landing at an airship dock on the eastern edge of the city. "I've registered your new airship with the harbormaster," Jerimo tells you, "she's in good hands and will be ready when you need her." Gundamar also bids you goodbye to continue his journey to JoSan, but not before giving Tilden a flagon of dwarvish fire wine.

You make your way through the bustling streets of Sakro Mendhi to the Temple of Flame. You know the entrace to the Mage Guild's hideout is nearby, and this part of the city is also a good place to stock up on supplies. As you gather around a public fountain outside the temple, you take stock of what's changed since you were last in Sakro Mendhi. Local Sakro Mendhans gather at the fountain to collect water and relax under the shade of plane trees. This is a merchant city, and trade seems to be as busy as ever. But you also see signs of a city on edge – you see more soldiers patrolling the streets than usual, and the barracks to your right seems to be on high alert.

The shout of a young boy rings out – "Papers for sale! Hot off the press! Papers for sale!" Sakro Mendhi is unique among bay cities for its vibrant culture of letters, and its use of wood block printing presses, rarities in almost every other part of the known world. "War in the west!" the boy continues, "Read all about it! Lucastown is under attack!"

Players can purchase a copy of "The Lion's Mouth" for 2 copper coins. It reads:

```
Rising in the West – THE SPECTER OF WAR!

Couriers travelling from the west in the past few days report that Lucastown is under siege. An army appeared seemingly overnight, and blockaded all land entrances to the city. A few merchants were able to escape by sea. The origin and demands of the army and its commanders are unknown. Witnesses report that they march under an orange banner defaced with a violet circle. Witnesses could not agree whether the soldiers were orcs, hobgoblins, or men. Stranger still, all witnesses agreed that the arrival of this army was preceded by the appearance of a great golden ORB, the size of a castle, floating in air outside Lucastown.
