Streets of Carnivale
--------------------

![Streets](./street-map-labeled.png)

Our players have been hooded for what feels like hours, unable to see anything. Eventually you hear the jingling of keys, the sound of a door opening, and a gruff voice orders you to stand up. You do with difficulty, as your hands are bound behind your backs.

You're lead down what sounds like a long echoing passageway. You almost stumble on some stairs, and you walk up into a brighter space. You flinch as someone steps behind you and unties your hands, and you're suddenly blinded as your hood is pulled off your head.

As your vision adjusts, you recognize the gnomish wizard who ambused you in the sewers. He's sitting at a modest wooden table, flanked by two imposing bodyguards.

"Thank you for taking the time to meet me," he says with a grin. "Seeing as we'll be working together, allow me to introduce myself – my name is Mercurio, and I manage a fraternal order of wizards. We're benevolent society, working to defend our interests, and you now work for us."

"I have a job that is uniquely suited for your talents.". Mercurio slides a parchment towards you. It looks like a street map, and he points at a block in the southeast corner of the map. "Three weeks ago a giant sphere materialized in the side of a building in downtown Carnivale. You might have heard some hub-bub about it. There's lots of speculating about what it might be, but my organization is confident that someone has warped a __planar sphere__ right in the middle of the prime material plane. We want that sphere, and you're going to get it for us."

"Here's where it gets tricky. That sphere is parked hundreds of feet up, and right in the middle of __Castle Yorba__. The Yorbans are a big important family here in Carnivale, and they're not letting anyone up to see it, at least not without paying some coin. So this little operation will require some tact. Any questions so far?"

He doesn't give you time to ask anything. "Good. Take this map, and take this too," he slides another piece of parchment, this one has a sequence of twelve runes written on it. "Your job is to get into that sphere, by any means necessary. The main stairwell inside Yorba castle should lead right up to it. Once you're inside the sphere, use this sigil sequence to warp to a rendezvous point. My people will be there to meet you."

Mercurio leans back in his chair, grinning. "Now get going." He has a self-satisfied look on his face that makes you want to punch him, or worse. But you can't – you feel resigned and defeated, and cannot summon the will to resist his orders. It's a crushing feeling, and you don't understand what's behind it.

### Restaurant

When you walk out of Mercurio's office you find yourself in a hot, smokey kitchen. A cook is chopping vegetables and doesn't even notice you. 

Walking out of the kitchen, you're surprised to find yourself in a restaurant. One patron nearby looks up, seems mildly suprised to see you, before returning to his meal. Out the  windows you see the hustle and bustle of a city street.

### The Streets

Commoners and horse carts travel up and down a cobble stone streets. It's a bright and sunny day and what you assume is Carnivale – some of you have been here before.

"Poppys! Poppys for sale!" A young elf boy (_orange square on map_) is hawking poppy flowers at the six-way intersection southwest of the restuarant. The players can ask him basic questions about the area – what merchants are nearby, and if he's heard any neighborhood gossip.

### Market

This shop has rows of tables covered in fruit, vegetables, fresh bread, sea food, and cured meats. A portly grocer is nearby organizing his wares.

The players can buy a variety of foods here, as well as beer and wine.

### Apothecary

An older woman is grinding something in a mortal and pestle, as mysterious liquids bubble and steam around here. "Come in, come in my dears," she says in a kind voice. "Potions, medicines, and herbs for all types, from housewives to wizards!"

The following items are for sale here:

* Potion of Greater Healing (4d4+4), 45 gold
* Potion of Superior Healing (8d4+8), 120 gold
* Potion of Speed (haste for 1 minute), 270 gold
* Cindar, 4 gold an ingot

### Wizardly Wares

A long, narrow room is lined with rows of bookshelves. There's barely enough space to squeeze past them. At the very back of the room, a dwarvish wizard in dingy robes is hunched over a book. He jolts up when you speak to him, and his spectacles fall of his face. "My goodness, sorry, very sorry, my mind was quite elsewhere. Are you looking for something in particular?"

The dwarf sells the following magical wares:

* Magical scrolls he happens to have transcribed
  * Glyph of Warding, 450 gold
  * Leomund's Tiny Hut, 430 gold
  * Dominate Person, 726 gold
  * Teleportation Circle, 1260 gold
* Various magical reagants, which the dwarf retrieves after rummaging in a back room.

### Armorer

A smartly dressed elvish man stands behind the counter. "Welcome to Meredith's Fine Armory. Are you looking for a particular piece?" The Elf caters primarily to wealthy collectors, but is excited to have clients who will actually wear his armors.

Almost any kind of armor or shield can be found here of ordinary quality. A few particularly fine pieces are also for sale:

* Masterwork Full Plate Armor, among the best made (18 AC + 2), 7400 gold pieces
* Mirror bright buckler, of elven craft (+1 to AC, 10% chance of deflecting spells and magical rays), 2400 gold
* Torque of Gundar, a solid gold torque (+2 to saves against all mind-affecting spells), 2000 gold

### The Tipsy Dragon

This tavern is in a beautiful, bright building with large windows looking out on the street. You're a bit shocked at the amount of glass. A fireplace crackles in the north corner, a few patrons are chatting and sipping drinks, and the barkeep is cleaning mugs behind the bar. A young man with blond hair and a rusty red cloak is sitting at the bar; he turns and looks at you when you come in.

When you approach the bar the young man is silent at first, but eventually he turns to whichever player is closest and addresses them by name. We flashes a small talisman as he speaks – it's a silver owl with ruby yes. His name is __Marek__.

"The guild has been looking for you – there's been a spectacular collapse of Nursey's cult in the past few days. Her undead followers have been returning to life, and her leadership has scattered. We suspect you might have been behind it, but wanted to confirm. Could you fill us in on the details?"

If the players inform Marek of the job Mercurio has sent them on, he'll grow very concerned. "The guild has been trying to gain access to the sphere for weeks. I'm not surprised the Magisters are also trying to get inside, but it's bad news." He explains to you that you can't get out of the job – if he's using his typical _modus operandi_, Mercurio has put you all under a __geas__, and you cannot resist his commands while the spell is in effect.

"I need to talk to the center about this and figure out what we can do. Meet me at the __Rose Inn__ in one hour; I'll be in the room at the end of the hall."

### Lucas Bank

Rich red carpeting covers white marble floors in this bright, spacious building. A wall of ornately decorated metal separates customers from bank tellers.

The bank manager – a portly gnome – is working in his office to the south. The players can request a __loan__ from the manager, but will pay it back over time with a magical spell that siphons off 10% of any gold they acquire until the loan is paid off, plus 15% interest. When they sign the loan contract, it disappears in a poof of blue smoke.

The bank vaults are behind the teller counter and can only be opened using the manager's __vault key__. An __iron golem__ is guarding the vaults and will attack anyone who enters, unless accompanied by the manager. If the manager manages to shout "code red!" the Golem will defend him

The west vault is filled with piles of gold, gems, and other precious metals. Players can grab as much as they can carry, but can only guess how much it's worth.

The east vault contains chests each filled with a pre-counted amount of gold coin, 10,000 gold per chest.

### Sisterhood of Thieves

An angry black cat is painted on the alleyway walls near this hideout. Brimlad will recognize this as the symbole of the __Sisterhood of Thieves__. She is friendly with this organization and will be able to get the party inside.

When you knock on this nondescript door, a small window slides open and a hooded guard will recognize Brimlad and let you all in.

In the east room, a large Aarakocra name __Salleek__ leans on the table smoking a long pipe. The smell of cindar fills the room. She recognizes Brimlad – "Long time no anything Brimlad, you hear to buy some contraband?" She intermittently chirps and squawks in her speech to convey emphasis and shades of meaning. She has the following items for sale:

* Throwing knives +1, 120 gold each.
* Thieves tools for lock picking, 30 gold a set.
* Grappling hook and 30 foot rope, 45 gold.
* A pouch of orange powder, when ingested or blown in the face of a living creature, they must pass a 16 constitution check or fall unconscious for 1d4 minutes. 1 pouch provides 10 doses, 390 gold.
* Explosive charge, this is an 8 inch tube with a fuse on one end. When embedded in a wall, it will blast a hole in ordinary stone or wood wall up to 5 feet thick. Magically reinforced walls, or metal walls, will not be affected. Anyone within a 15 foot cone of the blast will receive 6d8 blast damage. To work, it must be placed in a gap or whole in the wall at least 6 inches deep. 200 gold each.
* Diamond-tipped hand drill, drills a 6" hole in a wood wall in 1 minute, or stone in 10 minutes. You can subtract your strength modifier from the number of minutes, for a minimum of 1 minute. 75 gold.

A small, smokey tavern is in the west room. Only women are here, and they all wear the dark and practical garb of thieves. One half-elven women, wearing pitch black robes, beckons Brimlad when she sees her (_black hexagon on the map_). "Brimmie, where have you been all this time?" She throws her hood back. "It's me, __Eva__!"

If you tell Eva about your job in Castle Yorba, she'll laugh and say you have your work cut out for you. "The Yorbans are selling tickets to see that sphere for 50 thousand gold. As far as I know, no one has paid up, and who could anyway?" She offers the party some advice.

First, Eva's "free" advice – rob the Lucas Bank for 50 grand. "It's a hare-brained idea but Salleek has been pushing it for years, ask her about it if you're crazy enough to do it."

Second, Eva hints that she knows another way in Castle Yorba, but she won't give it to you for free. She'll tell you if you run a job for her – steal a letter addressed to "Desdomonda" from the __Malden residence__, and bring it back to her.

If the players bring Eva the letter, she'll tell them about the __Yorban Hideout__.

### Malden Residence

A small common green is outside this house. Some sheep are grazing within a fence.

An old man in worn out cloths is cooking some stew next fire in the south of the green – "Makin' lunch". If you make conversation with him, he'll tell you about his job. He's a gong farmer, carting "night soil" from the streets to the sewers below.

This richly appointed house is guarded by an imposing man in full plate armor (_green triangle on map_). He has no interest in making conversation with the players and won't let them in the house.

* Malden Guard
  * AC 18
  * HP 57
  * STR +2, DEX 0, CON +2, INT -1, WIS 0, CHA -1
  * Attacks: Greatsword, +2 to hit/1d12+2 damage, two attacks

Players can alternatively sneak in a back entrance. It's locked, but can be picked with a DC of 18.

A letter to "Desdemonda" sits on the desk in the bedroom. This is the letter __Eva__ is looking for. It appears to be a profession of love to a married woman.

### Yorban Hideout

The door to this hideout is covered in graffiti and the building looks abandoned. Inside you find a cache of weapons and a surprised Yorban Guard (__purple triangle on map__). He has an amulet on his neck that will allow you to pass through the magical barrier in the underground tunnel.

The stairway here leads to the underground tunnel to Castle Yorba (see __Yorba Hideout Entrance__ below).

### Castle Yorba

Castle Yorba is an enormous, pyramid-shaped tower. It dominates the cityscape. High up the tower, a featureless copper sphere is half-embedded in the side of the tower. The sphere is hundreds of feet wide.

The first thing you see when you enter the castle is a bear rug on the floor, and a finely dressed woman sitting behind a desk. Her face is impassive and she doesn't even nod to acknowledge your prescence, she just stares at you. "Hello, what business do you have with the House of Yorba?"

She informs you that the Yorban family is generous enough to allow magical researchers to see the sphere, for a modest fee of 50,000 gold coins. No amount of convincing will get her to do otherwise.

Yorban guards block the doors leading deeper into the castle.

On the otherside of these doors, a __Beholder__ is standing guard.

At the back of the Castle, the __castle stairway__ leads up the tower. The adventure ends when our intreped adventurers reach this stairway.

North of the castle stairway, another set of stairs leads underground to the __Yorban hideout__ tunnel.

Underground
-----------

![Underground](./underground-map-labeled.png)

This is a small network of sewers and tunnels below street level. It's accessible at three different entrances.

### Storeroom Entrance

Leads to the storeroom next to the Wizardly Wares shop.

The sewerway here is blocked by grates to the east.

### Yorba Hideout Entrance

Leads to the Yorba hideout at street level. A shimmering magic barrier is blocking passage down this tunnel. Players may only pass through the barrier if they are wearing the amulet worn by Yorban guards.

### Castle Yorba Entrance
