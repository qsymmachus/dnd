Portal Chamber
--------------

After stepping through the portal at the Architecture, our adventurers find themselves in a damp, hexagon-shaped room of stone. Water drips from the ceiling. About 30 feet ahead of them, they see narrow slits of light cast of the floor, and the sound of low voices. 

As they move forward past the threshold, they see large, reinforced double doors at the end of the room. Two smaller doors flank it. There are arrowslits carved in the stone walls, two to a side, and from one of them a voice rings out â€“ "which way does the bugbear run?" It's some kind of shibboleth. Unfortunately, our adventurers don't know the right answer.

They'll have to fight the figures behind the arrowslits, two wizards and two toughs, who begin firing bolts and blasting spells through the slits. All ranged player attacks through the arrowslits will be __with disadvantage__.

* Male Drow Wizard (_purple triangle to left_)
  * AC 14
  * HP 22
  * STR -1, DEX +1, CON 0, INT +2, WIS +1, CHA -1
  * Attacks: Dagger, 1d4

* Male Half-Orc fighter (_green triangle to left_)
  * AC 15
  * HP 35
  * STR +2, DEX 0, CON +2, INT -1, WIS -1, CHA -1
  * Attacks: Heavy crossbow, +1 to hit, 1d10
* Female Human Wizard (_purple triangle to right_)
  * AC 13
  * HP 28
  * STR 0, DEX 0, CON +1, INT +2, WIS +2, CHA +1

The main fortified door has no keyhole, and would require a strength DC of 35 to smash open. The side doors have keyholes, and can be picked with a DC of 16, or smashed with a strength DC of 22.

Once (if?) the players break through the doors and dispatch the defenders, they'll find a lever to the southeast. Pulling this lever will open the reinforced double doors. 

Small Barracks
--------------

This room looks like it was carved into the earth, the ceiling is held up with wooden beams. A few small beds and supplies are found here. If players search the supplies, they'll find some bread and cheese, a little skribane, and a cache of crossbow bolts.

The Sewerways
-------------

A network of tunnels runs through the map. They're narrow, damp, and a small stream of brackish water runs down their length. Humanoid-sized cutouts in the walls lead to small drains.
