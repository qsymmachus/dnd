Portal Chamber
--------------

After stepping through the portal at the Architecture, our adventurers find themselves in a damp, hexagon-shaped room of stone. Water drips from the ceiling. About 30 feet ahead of them, they see narrow slits of light cast of the floor, and the sound of low voices. 

As they move forward past the threshold, they see large, reinforced double doors at the end of the room. Two smaller doors flank it. There are arrowslits carved in the stone walls, two to a side, and from one of them a voice rings out – "which way does the bugbear run?" It's some kind of shibboleth. Unfortunately, our adventurers don't know the right answer.

They'll have to fight the figures behind the arrowslits, two wizards and two toughs, who begin firing bolts and blasting spells through the slits. All ranged player attacks through the arrowslits will be __with disadvantage__.

* Male Drow Wizard (_purple triangle to left_)
  * AC 14
  * HP 22
  * STR -1, DEX +1, CON 0, INT +2, WIS +1, CHA -1
  * Attacks: Dagger, 1d4
  * Spells: [Basic spells](./basic-spells.pdf)
* Male Half-Orc fighter (_green triangle to left_)
  * AC 15
  * HP 35
  * STR +2, DEX 0, CON +2, INT -1, WIS -1, CHA -1
  * Attacks: Heavy crossbow, +1 to hit, 1d10
* Female Human Wizard (_purple triangle to right_)
  * AC 13
  * HP 28
  * STR 0, DEX 0, CON +1, INT +2, WIS +2, CHA +1
  * Attacks: Dagger, 1d4
  * Spells: [Basic spells](./basic-spells.pdf)

  * AC 16
  * HP 30
  * STR +0, DEX +2, CON 0, INT 0, WIS +1, CHA 0
  * Attacks: Light crossbow, +2 to hit, 1d8

The main fortified door has no keyhole, and would require a strength DC of 35 to smash open. The side doors have keyholes, and can be picked with a DC of 16, or smashed with a strength DC of 22.

Once (if?) the players break through the doors and dispatch the defenders, they'll find a lever to the southeast. Pulling this lever will open the reinforced double doors. 

Small Barracks
--------------

This room looks like it was carved into the earth, the ceiling is held up with wooden beams. A few small beds and supplies are found here. If players search the supplies, they'll find some bread and cheese, a little skribane, and a cache of crossbow bolts.

The Sewerways
-------------

A network of tunnels runs through the map. They're narrow, damp, and a small stream of brackish water runs down their length. Man-sized cutouts in the walls lead to small drains.

At the northwestmost corner of the sewerways, a wizard who heard the commotion in the Portal Chamber is watching carefully (_torquoise triangle on the map_). He'll engage the players as soon as they're within eyeshot. He's a graying human wizard, wearing a sky blue robe. He seems quick on his feet, and will deftly use the terrain to his advantage, volleying magic down the sewerway while using the corner as cover.

Sky Blue Wizard (_torquoise triangle_)
  * AC 15
  * HP 36
  * STR 0, DEX +1, CON +0, INT +3, WIS +1, CHA +1
  * Attacks: unarmed only
  * Spells: [Advanced spells](./advanced-spells.pdf)
  * Items: Sky Robes. +1 to AC, 10% of deflecting a spell

The northmost sewerway is blocked by three Portcullis. The players can see light coming from a point down the tunnel, but it's too far to make out what's down there. These Porticullis can only be opened by the __three levers__ scattered around the map. The levers are located in

* The Boss Quarters
* The Contraband Room
* The Mess Hall

Armory
------

This room also seems to have been dug into the dirt recently. Tables covered in weapons, armor stands, and crates full of ammunition are located here. The players can find almost any basic weapon or piece of armor they need there.

Skribane Grow Operation
-----------------------

Two earthen tunnels lead to this room, following an S-shaped route. At the big bend of each tunnel, a magical trap has been set. The first player to pass through this bend will trigger the trap and must succeed on a will save of DC 24, or turn into a frog. They will remain a frog for 15 minutes, or until Dispel Magic is cast on them.

A careful observer (passive wisdom check of DC 19, active check of DC 15) will detect the trap. It is triggered by passing through a beam of light a mirror is reflecting onto the wall just beyond the tunnel bend. Players can avoid it by walking at a crouch.

The tunnels lead to a large, bright room carved into the earth. Magical lanterns, floating on the air, produce so much light it looks like day. Shoulder-high plants grow in diagonal rows, planted into the earth floor. They're all Skribane plants.

The Contraband Room
----------

This room is filled with crates, barrels, and shelves full of bottles. Two workbenches sit in the center, and they've covered in the tools of potion-making – mortar and pestle, alembics, magical flames, and so on. Strange smells, stains, and vapors fill the room.

A male dwarf is working at the tables. He's wearing googles and a leather apron, and has a blonde beard. He freezes when you enter, setting a bottle he was examing on the table. "Who the fuck are you?" he asks gruffly.

The dwarf is not here for conversation. He'll ask the players to get out, "or I'll stick yas", he states matter-of-factly, after pulling out a long stilleto from his belt. He doesn't answer any questions – "I ain't telling you nothing" – and will hold his ground unless the players start a fight. If they leave, he'll do nothing. If the players try to take anything from the room, he'll attack them.

The Potion Dwarf
  * AC 18
  * HP 75
  * STR +2, DEX 0, CON +3, INT 0, WIS +1, CHA -2
  * Attacks: Stilleto, +4 to hit, 1d6 damage + 2; two attacks per round
  * Items: +1 Stilleto

If the players dispatch the dwarf and are able to search the room, they'll find

* Crates full of Skribane and Cindar – more than they could possible hope to carry.
* Many bottles of liquor what tastes like liquor, with labels peeled off.
* Shelves of glass bottles. Someone with arcane knowledge will identify the following potions of interest:
  * Potion of climbing
  * Potion of Stone Giant Strength
  * Philter of Love
