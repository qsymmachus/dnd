Portal Chamber
--------------

After stepping through the portal at the Architecture, our adventurers find themselves in a damp, hexagon-shaped room of stone. Water drips from the ceiling. About 30 feet ahead of you, you see narrow slits of light cast on the floor, and the sound of low voices. 

As you move toward the threshold, you see large, reinforced double doors at the end of the room. Two smaller doors flank it. There are arrowslits carved in the stone walls, two to a side, and from one of them a voice rings out – "which way does the bugbear run?" It's some kind of shibboleth. Unfortunately, our adventurers don't know the right answer.

You'll have to fight the figures behind the arrowslits, two wizards and two toughs, who begin firing bolts and blasting spells through the slits. All ranged player attacks through the arrowslits will be __with disadvantage__.

* Male Drow Wizard (_purple triangle to left_)
  * AC 14
  * HP 22
  * STR -1, DEX +1, CON 0, INT +2, WIS +1, CHA -1
  * Attacks: Dagger, 1d4
  * Spells: [Basic spells](./basic-spells.pdf)
* Male Half-Orc fighter (_green triangle to left_)
  * AC 15
  * HP 35
  * STR +2, DEX 0, CON +2, INT -1, WIS -1, CHA -1
  * Attacks: Heavy crossbow, +1 to hit, 1d10
* Female Human Wizard (_purple triangle to right_)
  * AC 13
  * HP 28
  * STR 0, DEX 0, CON +1, INT +2, WIS +2, CHA +1
  * Attacks: Dagger, 1d4
  * Spells: [Basic spells](./basic-spells.pdf)
* Male Half-Elf fighter (_green triangle to right_)
  * AC 16
  * HP 30
  * STR +0, DEX +2, CON 0, INT 0, WIS +1, CHA 0
  * Attacks: Light crossbow, +2 to hit, 1d8

The main fortified door has no keyhole, and would require a strength DC of 35 to smash open. The side doors have keyholes, and can be picked with a DC of 16, or smashed with a strength DC of 22.

Once (if?) the players break through the doors and dispatch the defenders, they'll find a lever to the southeast. Pulling this lever will open the reinforced double doors. 

Small Barracks
--------------

This room looks like it was carved into the earth, the ceiling is held up with wooden beams. A few small beds and supplies are found here. If players search the supplies, they'll find 

* Some bread and cheese
* A little skribane
* A cache of crossbow bolts
* 8 potions of cure moderate wounds

The Sewerways
-------------

A network of tunnels runs through the map. They're narrow, damp, and a small stream of brackish water runs down their length. Man-sized cutouts in the walls lead to small drains.

At the northwestmost corner of the sewerways, a wizard who heard the commotion in the Portal Chamber is watching carefully (_torquoise triangle on the map_). He'll engage the players as soon as they're within eyeshot. He's a graying human wizard, wearing a sky blue robe. He seems quick on his feet, and will deftly use the terrain to his advantage, volleying magic down the sewerway while using the corner as cover.

Sky Blue Wizard (_torquoise triangle_)
  * AC 15
  * HP 36
  * STR 0, DEX +1, CON +0, INT +3, WIS +1, CHA +1
  * Attacks: unarmed only
  * Spells: [Advanced spells](./advanced-spells.pdf)
  * Items: Shimmering belt. +1 to AC, 10% chance of deflecting a spell

The northmost sewerway, which provides passage to the __Reservoir__, is blocked by three Portcullis. The players can see light coming from a point down the tunnel, but it's too far to make out what's down there. These porticullis can only be opened by the __three porticullis levers__ scattered around the map. The levers are located in:

* The Boss Quarters
* The Contraband Room
* The Mess Hall

Armory
------

This room also seems to have been dug into the dirt recently. Tables covered in weapons, armor stands, and crates full of ammunition are located here. The players can find almost any basic weapon or piece of armor they need there.

Skribane Grow Operation
-----------------------

Two earthen tunnels lead to this room, following an S-shaped route. At the big bend of each tunnel, a magical trap has been set. The first player to pass through this bend will trigger the trap and must succeed on a will save of DC 24, or turn into a frog. They will remain a frog for 15 minutes, or until Dispel Magic is cast on them.

A careful observer (passive wisdom check of DC 19, active check of DC 15) will detect the trap. It is triggered by passing through a beam of light a mirror is reflecting onto the wall just beyond the tunnel bend. Players can avoid it by walking at a crouch.

The tunnels lead to a large, bright room carved into the earth. Magical lanterns, floating on the air, produce so much light it looks like day. Shoulder-high plants grow in diagonal rows, planted into the earth floor. They're all Skribane plants.

The Contraband Room
----------

This room is filled with crates, barrels, and shelves full of bottles. Two workbenches sit in the center, and they've covered in the tools of potion-making – mortar and pestle, alembics, magical flames, and so on. Strange smells, stains, and vapors fill the room.

One of the three __porticullis levers__ is on the east wall. Pulling this will open of of the three porticullis blocking passage to the __reservoir__.

A male dwarf is working at the tables. He's wearing googles and a leather apron, and has a blonde beard. He freezes when you enter, setting a bottle he was examing on the table. "Who the fuck are you?" he asks gruffly.

The dwarf is not here for conversation. He'll ask the players to get out, "or I'll stick yas", he states matter-of-factly, after pulling out a long stilleto from his belt. He doesn't answer any questions – "I ain't telling you nothing" – and will hold his ground unless the players start a fight. If they leave, he'll do nothing. If the players try to take anything from the room, or pull the __porticullis lever__, he'll attack them.

The Potion Dwarf
  * AC 17
  * HP 75
  * STR +2, DEX +1, CON +3, INT 0, WIS -1, CHA -2
  * Attacks: Stilleto, +4 to hit, 1d6 damage + 2; two attacks per round
  * Items: +1 Stilleto

If the players dispatch the dwarf and are able to search the room, they'll find

* Crates full of Skribane and Cindar – more than they could possible hope to carry.
* Many bottles of what tastes like liquor, with the labels peeled off.
* Shelves of glass bottles. Someone with arcane knowledge will identify the following potions of interest:
  * Potion of climbing
  * Potion of Stone Giant Strength
  * Philter of Love

The Crystal
-----------

The twin doors to this room are covered in magic wards. They're completely unfamiliar to anyone in the party. Underneath the runes, you can faintly make out the letters "SFPUC".

An enormous purple crystal, 10 feet tall, is in the center of the narrow room. It pulses with light and humming energy. As you approach, you can feel your hair start to stand up on end, and an extremely loud, angry voice will shout out – "RELEASE ME! RELEASE ME NOW!" It seems like the voice is coming from inside the crystal.

Whatever intelligence may reside in the crystal has no interest in answering questions. It simply keeps shouting, and demanding that it "BE RELEASED". The humming sound will grow louder and louder if the players keep trying to communicate with it.

Finally, the Crystal lets out a long cry that shakes the walls, yells "DIE! DIE! DIE!", and begins shooting crackling bolts of purple lightning at the players. Each bolt deals 3d8 damage, players take half damage if they succeed a Dexterity roll of 18. The crystal cannot be harmed – weapons bounce off it harmlessly, and magic has no affect. The players can only leave the room, before the mysterious intelligence inside the crystal kills them.

Main Barracks
-------------

This room contains five narrow beds and table with a small amount of bread, cheese and sausage. There's a pot of tea that is still hot.

Boss Quarters
-------------

This room is much nicer than any you've seen so far – attractive tapestries hang from the walls, it's well lit by a floating lantern in the corner, and it smells like incense. An imposing desk and large chair upholstered in red leather sit in the center of the room. There's a step ladder in front of the chair.

The desk has no papers on it, only a tightly fitted wooden box that contains six large, expertly rolled Cindar cigars.

The north bookshelves contains ledgers and account books for "product" or "bottles", and other suspiciously vague inventory.

A small bedroom lies around the corner. A __porticullis lever__ is on the wall, if the players pull this, it opens one of the three porticullis blocking passage to the __Reservoir__.

The chest at the foot of the bed is trapped (detected with a passive wisdom check of 20, active check of 14). The trap can be disarmed with a DC of 21, if the disarm fails it will trigger the trap. Otherwise, the trap will be triggered by the first person who opens the chest, dealing 3d8 of acid damage. Inside the chest they will find:

* 638 gold pieces
* Shimmering scarlet wizard robes covered in silver stars. The robe, when worn, provides damage resistance to all fire and lightning damage.

Sphere
------

This room is shaped like a circle with a dome ceiling. The walls seem to be made of perfectly smooth rock.

A round table is at the center of the room, upon which sits a dark glass __orb__. When you peer into the orb, its inky color recedes, and you see flickering images of different people and places:

You see a hooded man walking down a busy town street, then the image dissolves to show two figures standing at a dock, whispering to one another; now, a large warehouse; then, the image flits again to reveal an enormous tower, shaped like a pyramid, with a giant bronze sphere embedded in its side, hundreds of feet up. The orb is constantly cycling through these different images, all actively observed through some powerful magic, unfamiliar to any of you.

If a player touches the orb, they will be blinded for an hour. A successful passive wisdom check of 22 from any of the players will give them a strong intuition that the orb shouldn't be tampered with.

Dungeon Cells
-------------

When you enter this room you startle a portly man sitting on a stool by the door. He fumbles a bit, but grabs a club leaning against the wall, shouts for help, and tries to stop the players.

* Dungeon Guard
  * AC 12
  * HP 15
  * STR +2, DEX -2, CON +1, INT -1, WIS -1, CHA 0
  * Attacks: Club, 1d8 damage
  * Items: Keyring

His keyring will open all of the cells lining this dark, dank corridor. The second-to-last cell, which seems to have been reinforced to make the space between cell bars smaller, contains none other than the __Grundler__ (_orange diamond on the map_).

The Grundler is quite excited to see you, and asks you to unlock his cell if you haven't already. At first he thinks you're here to rescue him, or on some other mission from the Mage's Guild, and is surprised to learn you don't even know where you are. He explains that he was caught spying on what he calls "the Maggies", or the Fraternal Order of Magisters, and that this is one of their safe houses, hidden in the sewers of Carnivale.

He goes on to explain that the Magisters are a powerful and feared organization of wizards based in Carnivale. They are ostensibly a "fraternal order" for mutual support, but in reality a criminal conspiracy involved in the drug trade, production of magical contraband, and research into unethical and dangerous forms of magic. For these reasons and more, they attract the attention of the Guild, with whom they've been engaged in a secret war for many years.

Incidentally, as the Grundler is telling you all this, he's casually searching the body of the dungeon guard, taking his belt, dagger, sack of coins, and cinching it around his narrow goblin waist.

He goes on to tell you that you're lucky to find yourselves in these sewers now, because the "big boss" and most of the other wizards are not here. He explains that your best hope of escape is through the reservoir entrance, past the porticullis, and he tells you where the three levers are. 

He, however, is going to take the "tight exit", and as he says that he heads out the door and walks south toward a sewer grate in the floor. Saluting you goodbye, he slips through the grate and disappears.

Summoning Chamber
-----------------

This room is illuminated by the glowing magical circle carved into the stone floor. The space forboding and smells like burnt hair. The closer you get to the circle, the more wary you feel. An arcane knowledge check, depending on how high it is, will reveal some of the following details: this is a summoning room, the circle is a magical gate, and judging by the magical inscriptions within the circle, it is designed to contain something malevolent. 

Mess Hall
---------

This space looks like a dive bar except it's been carved into the earth. A half-orc appears to be passed out drunk at a nearby table, and is snoring loudly.

One of the __porticullis levers__ is found on the wall behind the bar.

Reservoir
---------

Once you have opened all three __porticullis__ you may proceed up the long sewerway that leads north. It opens up to a large, hexagonal room made of brick, with brick columns supporting a 30 foot ceiling. At the back wall, you see a ladder leading up to what looks like a manhole cover.

As soon as the players step toward the center of this room, they are immediately surrounded by a circle of wizards in many-colored robes who materialize suddenly out of thin air. Any player who can see into the ethereal plane would have already noticed them hiding there, but they won't have time to react.

A short but imposing gnome in bright blue robes is standing at the head of the circle. He is bald, but has a large white moustache, and one of his eyes seems to have been replaced with a glowing orange crystal. All the wizards have various wands and staffs aimed at you; only the gnome seems relaxed, with has arms folded at his chest.

"The Guild has the fucken' balls to come into MY HOUSE", the gnome intones, "and fuck about with MY BUSINESS". He spits on the ground, leaving the tell-tale green saliva of the Skribane dipper.

"Let's just kill them" says a haughty elf woman to your left. The gnome cuts her off – "I'm not going to waste this opportunity".

He interrogates you, and seems certain that you're agents of the Guild. He wants to know how you got inside. He doesn't believe your claim that you ended up here accidentally, especially since it's clear you've killed a number of his "associates".

"You're going to pay for this," the gnome concludes, "you have a debt that needs to be paid. Fortunately for you, it won't be paid in blood. From now on, you work for me!"

With a flick of his wrists the gnome casts a spell on the group – all must make a wisdom save of 25 or fall asleep. Players who resist are quickly overpowered by the group of wizards, and you all slip into darkness.
